# VDOM Runtime

## Installation

The first is needed to check that system meets all requirements:

* ply (pip install ply)
* pillow (pip install pillow)
* pycrypto (pip install pycrypto)
* sqlite (pip install pysqlite; copy dll for windows)
* sqlitebck (copy dll for windows)
* xapian (copy module for windows)
* xappy (copy module for windows)
* python-ldap (pip install python-ldap)
* soappy (pip install soappy)

Then download latest runtime. After that must be performed deploy action:

    python manage.py deploy

This action creates required directories and install all types from repository directory.

## Quick start

There are two executable files in the sources directory:

* server.py - main runtime server executable
* manage.py - auxiliary management utility

To install and select application you can use manage.py utility:

    python manage.py install <application XML file location>
    python manage.py select <application uuid or name>

For more detailed information see below.

## Starting runtime server

To start server just type:

    python server.py

Configuration can be found in the settings.py file, also server supports several command line arguments:

* -l, --listen - specify address to listen
* -p, --port - specify port
* -a, --applicaiton - specify application to serve
* -c, --configure - specify filename to load settings
* --preload - preload default application
* --profile - enable profiling

### Override settings

Command line:

    python server.py -c settings.ini

File contents:

    SERVER-ADDRESS = "gerg"
    SERVER-PORT = 4234

## Using manage utility

This utility can be used to perform several maintenance tasks, for example:

* install or uninstall application
* select default application
* list available applications and types
* query internal state from server
* show last stored profile

To perform action utility can be called from the command line as follow:

    python manage.py <action> <arguments>...

Or can work in interactive mode - just lunch manage.py without arguments.

### Install application or type

Install application or type from desired location, install all types from repository or install appropriate type from repository.

Actions:

    install <location>
    install types
    install <type name>

Where *location* is the location of the application XML file.

Example:

    install x:\data\promail.xml

### Uninstall application or type

Uninstall application, type or all installed types.

Actions:

    uninstall <identifier>
    uninstall types

Where *identifier* is an application or type name or uuid.

Example:

    uninstall promail

### Delete application

Emergency delete application and cleanup infrastructure without proper uninstall procedure.

Actions:

    delete <identifier>

Where *identifier* is an application uuid.

Example:

    delete 7f459762-e1ba-42d3-a0e1-e74beda2eb85

### Select default application

Select default application or display current one.

Action:

    select
    select <identifier>

Where *identifier* is an application name or uuid.

Example:

    select promail

### List available applications and types

Action:

    list

### View log

Display actual server log and update it in the realtime.

Action:

    log

### Show application or type details

Show some information about available application or type like id, name, attributes and so on.

Action:

    show <identifier>

Where *identifier* is an application name or uuid.

Example:

    show form

## Debugging and profiling

Manage utility also have several actions to help with debugging and profiling.

### Show objects statistics

This action require enabled watcher.

Show objects statistics for all server objects or accumulated from the last snapshot.

Action:

    watch analyze

Example:

    watch analyze --all --lim 75 --sort counter

This command show 75 most common object types including built-in and sorted by count.

### Memorize objects state

This action require enabled watcher.

This action force watcher to memorize current object state and show further statistics on changes form this snapshot.

Action:

    watch memorize

### Query object graph

This action require enabled watcher.

Action:

    watch query graph <fully qualified type name>
    watch query graph <fully qualified type name> <location>

Where *fully qualified type name* is a full type name with module and *location* is the file name or directory for the resulting graph file.

Example:

    watch query graph memory.application.object.MemoryObject c:\temp --depth 5

There we request object graph for all (memory.application.object.)MemoryObject objects with depth of 5.

### Show profiling statistics

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    profile show
    profile show tasks

### Drop profiling statistics

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    profile drop
    profile drop tasks

### Query profiling statistics

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch query profile c:\temp
    watch query profile c:\temp tasks

### Query profiling callgraph

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch query callgraph c:\temp
    watch query callgraph c:\temp tasks

### Check profiling status

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch profiling

### Enable or disable profiling

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch profiling --enable
    watch profiling --disable

### Show or change log level

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch logging
    watch logging --level <log level>

Where *log level* is a one of *debug*, *message*, *warning* or *error*.

Example:

    watch logging --level warning

### Show or change show page debug

This command require enabled profiler.

Action:

    watch debugging
